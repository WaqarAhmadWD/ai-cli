# üåü **help_ai**

_help_ai_ is an npm CLI tool designed to assist non-CLI developers and DevOps engineers in configuring and completing terminal tasks with a single prompt.

## ‚ú® **Features**

- **AI-Powered Assistance**

  - Leverage the Gemini 1.5 Flash model by default. You can acquire the API key from Google Gemini API.
  - It also supports OpenAI GPT-3.5, allowing flexibility in the model used.

- **Automatic Execution of Terminal Commands**

  - Handles individual commands or a series of operations across different terminal types (shell, bash, etc.).
  - Automatically executes terminal commands, removing the complexity of manual entry.

- **Advanced Debugging**
  - Identifies and resolves terminal issues by generating and running debugging commands.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How it Works?**

_help_ai_ is extremely user-friendly and works in a straightforward manner:

- **User Input**
  1. **User Input:** You provide a prompt describing your terminal task.
  2. **AI Processing:**The tool sends the prompt to the AI with default instructions. It receives a series of terminal commands in return.
  3. **Command Execution:** These commands are executed sequentially. In case of failure, the tool rolls back the changes and reverts to AI for new commands.
  4. **Retry Mechanism:** The process will repeat up to 5 times (this can be adjusted based on your needs) until the task is completed successfully.
  5. **Success Message:** Once successful, a completion message will be displayed to the user.

## üöÄ **Important Notes**

**\*Caution with Dangerous Prompts**
When using _help_ai_ in default mode, avoid entering commands that could potentially harm your system or disrupt important processes.

**Future Plans**
We are actively developing new features, including additional AI models and operational modes such as: - Debugging Mode - Safe Mode - Sandbox Mode
These modes will offer better safety, advanced debugging, and controlled environments for experimenting with terminal tasks.
